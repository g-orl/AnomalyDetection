# AnomalyDetection

Machine sound anomaly detection task

The task for this challenge is to detect unknown
anomalous sounds under the condition that only normal
sound samples have been provided as training data.
Anomalous sound detection in industrial environments
is essential for preventing malfunctions and ensuring
operational efficiency. This task focuses on detecting
such anomalies using data from the ToyADMOS and
MIMII datasets, specifically targeting slide rail ma-
chines. Different models will be proposed and their
capability of generalizing to new data will be studied.
